# PathFinder

This is a website called __PathFinder__. PathFinder is built to help you plan out your career, 
whether that be as a student looking for the typical job in your city, an employer trying to grow 
your company, or a professional looking to bulk up your resume for your next big career move.

### Feature Functions
We at PathFinder have designed three unique search features that you can access using tabs above. The __Job Skills__ tab allows you to search for a job title and view a graphic of the frequency of key words like skills or job duties. The __Jobs Near You__ tab allows you to search for a location of interest and view the most common job positions in that location. The __Hiring?__ tab allows you to search for a job position and a location of interest to get an ‘average’ pay of said job in the location. Each of these features generates a bar graph search result. If you have signed-up for a PathFinder account and are logged-in, you will be able to save your searches using the red *Save new search* button (See the __Accounts__ heading below for more details on PathFinder accounts). This save button will save the bar graph result to alist of recent searches that you can revisit using the __Recent Searches__ tab

#### Accounts
You can sign up for a PathFinder account using the account button on the navigation bar. A modal will pop up giving you a chance to either sign up or log-in using and email-password combination. 

##### Privacy Policy
PathFinder will __NOT__ save, distrubute, or use your account information for any purpose other than allowing you to view your saved searches from our __Recent Searches__ tab.
